Two major emperors from the Chozha kingdom include Raja Raja Chozhan and his son Rajendra Chozhan. Although the areas governed by Rajendra Chozhan were comparatively higher than his father Raja Raja Chozan, he laid the groundwork for this.

In today's world, even a kind might know that it was Raja Raja Chozhan who built the famous Periya Koil of Thanjavur aka Brihadeeshwara Temple. But around 145 years back i.e., before 1887, no one really knew about the king.  A German indologist and epigraphist named E. Hultzsch was appointed during the British rule to analyze the inscriptions.
It was him who rediscovered that the Periya Koil was actually built by the emperor Raja Raja Chozhan. He then published all his findings about the Periya Koil in the 2nd volume of his book South Indian Inscriptions. The inscription says:

    பாண்டிய குலாசனி வளநாட்டுத் தஞ்சாவூர்க் கூற்றத்துத் தஞ்சாவூர் நாம்
    எடுப்பிச்ச திருக்கற்றளி ஶ்ரீஇராஜராஜீஸ்வரம்

Copper plates and Inscriptions found after this tell us about the history of later Chozhas and a few other 
information about Raja Raja Chozhan

Raja Raja Chozhan considered that the temple was not just his own achievement, but the achievement of each and every living organism who were involved in constructing the temple.

The names of the members of the officials, engineers, farmers, citizens of Chozha Kingdom,  who were instrumental in constructing the temple were carved in the inscriptions of the Periya Koil. And he named the temple as Raja Rajeshwaram.

The nearby temples were named after his Commander-in-Chief Krishnan Raman @ Mummudi Chozha Brahmmaraayan.

The chief sculptor of the temple Kunjaramannan was titled after him as Raja Raja Perunthatchar. Even his name is carved in the inscriptions.

The names of the dancers, Thevaram (a Daiva narrative of epic and puranic heroes) reciters, musicians, securities were also carved on the inscriptions of the temple. The exact addresses of the homes donated to these people were also carved. Also, the assistants of these people and the names of their washerwomen and washermen were also carved. The hairdresser who was again named after Raja Raja Chozhan as Raja Raja perunaabeesan was also carved on the temple walls.

Raja Raja Chozhan felt that the contribution from each and every worker is same in the eyes of the main deity.

He is the only king who said that everyone is equal from the chief engineer till the ground level worker.
