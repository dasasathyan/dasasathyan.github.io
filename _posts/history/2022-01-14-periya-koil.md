Two major emperors from the Chozha kingdom include Raja Raja Chozhan and his son Rajendra Chozhan. Although the areas governed by Rajendra Chozhan were comparatively higher than his father Raja Raja Chozan, he laid the groundwork for this.

In today's world, even a kid might know that it was Raja Raja Chozhan who built the famous Periya Koil of Thanjavur aka Brihadeeshwara Temple. But around 145 years back i.e., before 1887, no one really knew about the king.  A German indologist and epigraphist named E. Hultzsch was appointed during the British rule to analyze the inscriptions.
It was him who rediscovered that the Periya Koil was actually built by the emperor Raja Raja Chozhan. He then published all his findings about the Periya Koil in the 2nd volume of his book South Indian Inscriptions. Copper plates and Inscriptions found after this tell us about the history of later Chozhas and a few other 
information about Raja Raja Chozhan. One inscription reads:

    பாண்டிய குலாசனி வளநாட்டுத் தஞ்சாவூர்க் கூற்றத்துத் தஞ்சாவூர் நாம்
    எடுப்பிச்ச திருக்கற்றளி ஶ்ரீஇராஜராஜீஸ்வரம்

Raja Raja Chozhan considered that the temple was not just his own achievement, but the achievement of each and every living organism who were involved in constructing the temple. Hence he said "We Constructed this temple Raja Rajeshwaram"

But why is it a wonder in terms of construction?

1. The shrine tower (Gopuram) where Lord Shiva is worshiped is a shallow structure. The top of the Gopuram is visible from the Shiva Lingam.

1. The outer wall of the tower is constructed using rocks and these rocks are placed on top of each other without any bonding material such as cement using inter-locking mechanism. It is not even possible to insert a single sheet of paper between these rocks. And it is still standing strong, even after 1,000 years of facing a few invasions, 6 earthquakes and a few other natural disasters.

1. The long outside corridor from Shiva Lingam to the Nandi outside which now has just 1 floor had 2 floors when Raja Raja Chozhan initially constructed. There are still traces that support this. 

2. There are still Fresco paints in the first floor of the external corridor describing a lot of history on Lord Shiva.

3. The names of the members of the officials, engineers, farmers, citizens of Chozha Kingdom,  who were instrumental in constructing the temple were carved in the inscriptions of the Periya Koil. And he named the temple as Raja Rajeshwaram.

4. The nearby mandapams(halls) called Thiru Chittru Maaligai were named after his Commander-in-Chief Krishnan Raman @ Mummudi Chozha Brahmmaraayan.

5. The chief sculptor of the temple Kunjaramannan was titled after him as Raja Raja Perunthatchar. Even his name is carved in the inscriptions.

6. The names of the dancers, Thevaram (a Daiva narrative of epic and puranic heroes) reciters, musicians, securities were also carved on the inscriptions of the temple. The exact addresses of the homes donated to these people were also carved. Also, the assistants of these people and the names of their washerwomen and washermen were also carved. The hairdresser who was again named after Raja Raja Chozhan as Raja Raja perunaabeesan was also carved on the temple walls.

7. Shepherds were appointed to extract Ghee from cattle to light up the lamps of the temple. The names of these shepherds have also been inscribed on the inscriptions. And he has also ordered that the profit from the extra Ghee after being used to light up the lamps may be taken by the shepherds themselves.

8. Raja Raja Chozhan felt that the contribution from each and every worker is same in the eyes of the main deity.

9. The details of each piece of jewelry belonging to the temple, including the quantity of gold, nine precious stones, mineral stones,  pearls etc., were also inscribed in the inscriptions.

10. There is also an inscription that states that there was a bank functioning and its rate of interest on loans.

11. He is the only king who said that everyone is equal from the chief engineer till the ground level worker.

There are a lot of myths about this shrine that are completely false. They are

1. The top rock (Kalasam) is 80 tons and is a unique piece of rock. It's a collection of smaller pieces of stones.

2. The shadow of the temple tower does not fall onto the earth.

3. There's a Chinese figure in the tower. He is a surveyor whose heavy machinery broke on of the pieces of the stone. Hence his image was replaced there.
