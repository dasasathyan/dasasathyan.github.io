Though he was on continuous war expeditions, on the other hand, he made sure of the smooth functioning of the Government even in his absence. A book called "Doomsday book" is a manuscript of the "Great Survey" of England which was completed in 1086 by the order of William I.  But in the year 1001 Raja Raja Chozhan ordered Raja Raja Marayan to measure all the lands under the Chozha kingdom which was approximately 85 years before the Doomsday was completed. The Raja Raja Marayas was then called Ulagalanthaan. The land was measured on the basis of Agricultural land, River beds and Towns/Villages where people live.

For ease of governance, the entire Chozha kingdom was divided into 9 territorial divisions called Mandalam. They are 

1. Chozha Mandalam
2. Malai Mandalam
3. Vengi Madalam (Eastern Chalukyas)
4. RajaRaja Pandi Mandalam (Pandya Kingdom)
5. Jayankonda Chozha Mandalam (Thondai Nadu. Current day Northern Tamil Nadu and Southern Andhra Pradesh)
6. Mummudi Chozha Mandalam (Sri Lanka)
7. Mudikonda Chozha Mandalam (Ganga Nadu. Current day Mysore and other regions)
8. Nigarili Chozha Mandalam (Nulambadi. Current day Andhra Karnataka borders like Bellary, Ananthapur, Tumkur, Bangalore, Kolar and regions)
9. Athiraasaraasa Chozha Mandalam (Kongu Nadu. Current day Western Tamil Nadu, South Eastern Karnataka and Eastern Kerala)

The first 3 divisions (Chozha Mandalam, Malai Mandalam, Vengi Madalam) are some of the oldest divisions. But rest 6 were named after the names of Raja Raja Chozhan.

As land tax is the primary source of revenue for the Chozha dynasty,  officials were employed for the timely collection and reporting of the land tax. They are called Puragu vari thinaikkalam (புரகுவரித்திணைக்களம்)

For the peace and order of the kingdom, most of the cases were dealt and judgments were given in local panchayats. The kingdom had its officials to maintain peace and order.
