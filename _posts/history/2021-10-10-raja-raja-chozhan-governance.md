But in the year 1001 Raja Raja Chozhan ordered Raja Raja Marayan to measure all the lands under the Chozha kingdom which was approximately 85 years before the Doomsday was completed. The Raja Raja Marayas was then called Ulagalanthaan. The land was measured on the basis of Agricultural land, River beds and Towns/Villages where people live.

Kings those days very well knew that only if Agriculture prospers the country prospers. All the kings brought in a lot of water harvesting plans, irrigation systems like man-made lakes & ponds.
