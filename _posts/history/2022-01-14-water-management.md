Kings those days very well knew that only if Agriculture prospers the country prospers. All the kings brought in a lot of water harvesting plans, irrigation systems like man-made lakes & ponds. But Raja Raja Chozhan mastered the art of river management. Uyyakondaan and Keerthimaan are a few distributary channels that flow from large rivers during Raja Raja Chozhan's rule. In places where there are no large rivers, man-made lakes were made.

Today, people are still struggling to establish a Cauvery Water Regulation Committee, he established a Uyyakondan lake committee 1000 years back. From Uyyakondam lake, close to 2000 man-made tributaries were made in the current day districts of Thanjavur, Pudukottai. The water flows from the Uyyakondan river to the next river, from there to the one after that and so on and on.

He also established Kumizhi Thoombu floodgate (Roughly termed as Bubble Pillar floodgate in english) a stone like structure built scientifically to open stagnant water for irrigation. A hole is made halfway through the pillars and a couple of holes at the bottom and the holes are covered with a stone. Pipes are connected to the underground of the pillar for the water to flow for agricultural fields. The pure water flows through the 1st hole and the dirt flows along with the water through the 2nd hole. This reduces the sedimentation under the lake.

He has also carved his names on those pillars so that people treat those pillars with the same respect as the king himself.

He was also named as Siva Paadha Sekaran (Feet of Lord Siva at my head). He says that he keeps the feet of people who preserve such lakes and Kumizhu Thoombu at his head. The head where the feet of Lord Siva are kept. Such was the importance given by him for people's welfare.
