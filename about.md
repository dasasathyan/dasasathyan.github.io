I am an Accoutant turned Software Engineer. I am a full stack developer with a DevOps flavour. I have been coding in Ruby, Python, Java, PHP and a lot more for 6+ years. I love to containerize, develop, build, test and deploy. 

I am a historyphile. Always free to talk about history and visit historical sites.

I also travel a lot.

In this blog, I share with what I play in technology, what I explore in history, how I have fun
