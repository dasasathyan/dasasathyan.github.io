I am an Accountant turned Software Engineer. I am a full stack developer with a DevOps flavour. I have been coding in Ruby, Python, Java, PHP and a lot more for 6+ years. I love to containerize, develop, build, test and deploy. 

I am a Historyphile. Always free to talk about History and visit historical sites.

I also travel a lot.

In this blog, I share what I play in technology, what I explore in history, how I have fun

A special thanks to Mr. Lakshmi Narasimhan who has been mentoring me for the past 8+ years. It was him who introduced me to the world of DevOps. Read more about him [here](https://www.lakshminp.com)
