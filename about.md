I am an Accoutant turned Software Engineer. I am a full stack developer with a DevOps flavour. I have been writing code in Ruby, Python, Java, PHP for more than 6 years. I containerize, develop, build, test and deploy. 

I am a history loving person. I love to explore lost Indian history.

I also travel a lot.

In this blog, I share with what I play in technology, what I explore in history, how I have fun
